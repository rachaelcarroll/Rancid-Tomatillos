## Overview and Project Goals
Welcome to Rancid Tomatillos - the latest and greatest movie browsing application! 

The goal of this Mod3 partner [project](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-3/rancid-tomatillos-v3.html) was to create a React app that allows users to browse through a collection of movies and see what peaks their interest.  They may also search for a specific movie title, read the movie's details, and watch the movie trailer.

### Learning Goals

To solidify and demonstrate the understanding of:

- React fundamentals 
- Testing React components & asynchronous JS
- Creating a multi-page UX using Router

## Functionality 

#### View All Movies 
- A user may browse a collection of movies on the main page<br>
